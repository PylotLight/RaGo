# Issues
- can you get all pods? = "get pods": prompt not generating full command? monitor after improved system prompt
- allow more command option versitility: improved
- I also need to fix response stability: improved specific system prompt / schema defintion updates / pattern matching?
- access kubectl/sh/bulbs from pod
- use cloudflared/warp for local access?

# Features
- skate for auth/secrets?
- add external accessiblity with auth support for external connection

- add sudo support for zpool/dmesg access
- allow for general AI queries dynamically, rag/action':' option?
