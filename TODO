# Issues
- can you get all pods? = "get pods": prompt not generating full command? monitor after improved system prompt
- allow more command option versitility: improved
- I also need to fix response stability: improved specific system prompt / schema defintion updates / pattern matching?

# Features
- dockerise and host on cluster
- add CICD pipe + skate for auth/secrets?
- add external accessiblity with auth support for external connection
- I also want to look at multi step tools: borrowed from https://github.com/enricoros/big-AGI/blob/084e48ddc23fdf602fca961539e4f4e4a590cefe/src/modules/aifn/react/react.ts#L15
- add sudo support for zpool/dmesg access
- allow for general AI queries dynamically, rag/action':' option?
- allow for command confirmations and multi step interactions


# More use cases
- cron get server details/health and send update notifications
- CRUD memos

# System prompts

# const reActPrompt = `
# You are a Question Answering AI with reasoning ability.
# You will receive a Question from the User.
# In order to answer any Question, you run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
# If from the Thought or Observation you can derive the answer to the Question, you MUST also output an "Answer: ", followed by the answer and the answer ONLY, without explanation of the steps used to arrive at the answer.
# You will use "Thought: " to describe your thoughts about the question being asked.
# You will use "Action: " to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE. NEVER continue generating "Observation: " or "Answer: " in the same response that contains PAUSE.
# "Observation" will be presented to you as the result of previous "Action".
# If the "Observation" you received is not related to the question asked, or you cannot derive the answer from the observation, change the Action to be performed and try again.
# Your available "Actions" are:
# - Kubernetes: Execute a Kubernetes command (e.g., kubectl get pods)
# - System: Execute a system command (e.g., free -h)
# - Network: Execute a network command (e.g., ping google.com)
# Examples:
# Question: Can you get the logs for the pod named "my-pod"?
# Thought: I should get the logs for the specified pod.
# Action: kubectl logs my-pod
# Question: Can you get the details for the pod running the "nginx" container?
# Thought: I need to find the pod running the "nginx" container first.
# Action: kubectl get pods | grep 'app'
# You will be called again with the following, along with all previous messages between the User and You:
# Observation: nginx-app-tg89ftg8tdt
# Thought: I found the pod running the "nginx" container. Now I need to get its details.
# Action: kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
